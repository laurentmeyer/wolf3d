# wolf3d

### A graphics assignment, for the school 42
In C99, provided only with a windowing system that lets you print a pixel on screen.
The goal is to recreate a raycasting engine, similar to the one in Wolfenstein3D by ID Software.

To build on OSX, clone the repo and `make`.

Then, use it with the pre-made map: `./wolf3d test.map`, or create your own.
